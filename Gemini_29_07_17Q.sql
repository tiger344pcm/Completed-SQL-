-- ‚úÖ SQL Project: Multi-Dimensional Data Analysis for Marketing & HR Insights

-- Alhamdulillah, I successfully completed a hands-on SQL 
-- analysis project focused on real-world business scenarios across sales,
--  products, customer behavior, and employee management.

-- üîç Key Highlights:

-- Used JOINS to retrieve complex relationships like customer order details,
--  unassigned employees, and category-specific sales.

-- Applied SUBQUERIES to identify products never ordered, employees earning above
-- department averages, and customers purchasing premium products.

-- Leveraged WINDOW FUNCTIONS (like RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), LAG(), and RUNNING TOTAL) 
-- to perform time-series sales analysis and determine top performers.

-- Performed GROUP BY and HAVING clause operations to calculate aggregated sales per
-- product category and filter high-performing departments.


-- üìä Skills Demonstrated:

-- Business-driven data retrieval

-- Advanced SQL logic (Window, Subqueries, Aggregations)

-- Data storytelling through structured queries


-- This project has significantly enhanced my confidence in solving analytical
-- SQL challenges and strengthened my readiness for data analyst roles, in shaa Allah.
